# Project Objetive : Problem Statement
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a communicable respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that causes illness in humans.
Infected air droplets that are released during sneezing or coughing spread the disease from person to person. It can also be spread when humans come into contact with virus-infected hands or surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth with the contaminated hands.
COVID-19 was first reported in China, but it has now spread throughout the world. A lot of countries implemented lockdowns to contain the spread of this disease while finding medical solutions to cure the disease. Data of the reports of these cases: confirmed, dead, and even those who have recovered are available in real-time.
As an aspiring data analyst, I have been able to analyze this data, thanks to the NG30DaysofLearning Program. This analysis provides an insight into the data provided for cases all over the world.

# Data Sourcing
This data was sourced from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University
https://aka.ms/30DLCOVID19GitHubData and the analysis were done with Excel.

# Data Transformation
The raw data was loaded from the web into excel using its source code in the order of confirmed, death and recovered and Power Query was used for its transformation. 
After the data was loaded into the Power Query, the columns: State/Province, Country/Region, Longitude, latitude were kept constant while the other columns were unpivoted. Column names were corrected and the data types were also appropriately formatted then the 3 different datasets(confirmed, death and recovered) were merged. The transformed data were then loaded back to excel and pivot tables/charts were inserted to create the dashboard.
